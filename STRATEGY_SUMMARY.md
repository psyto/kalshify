# Fabrknt Strategy Summary
## The Tinder for Web3 Partnerships - Built on Verified Data

**Updated:** January 3, 2026 (V3 - Verified Data Only)
**Status:** Finalized Strategy

---

## 🎯 The Core Insights (Your Vision)

### **Insight 1: Partnerships Save Startups**
> **"Big VCs have enough connections to evaluate companies. Most Web3 startups got failed. There is no easy way to evaluate Web3 companies by data. That's why we need a platform where people can evaluate Web3 companies by data and make partnerships to survive."**

### **Insight 2: Verified Data Only (Web3-Native)**
> **"The value of Web3 is openness. All data are available on-chain and online. I don't want users to enter data - it's not verified. I want to use only verified data collected from on-chain and online sources."**

### **Insight 3: Tinder-Like Matching**
> **"I want to have a feel like a matching app (Tinder or so), which makes connections between previously unknown companies. I would like as many companies as possible to register this service."**

This is **BRILLIANT** because:
- ✅ VCs don't need us (they have connections)
- ✅ Struggling startups DO need us (they're dying in isolation)
- ✅ Verified data = Web3-native (trustless, transparent)
- ✅ Auto-generated profiles = zero barrier to entry
- ✅ Tinder UX = familiar, addictive, viral
- ✅ Market is 50x bigger (1000 struggling companies vs 20 top companies)

---

## 📊 Strategic Pivot

### **What We're NOT:**
- ❌ NOT an M&A advisory for top protocols
- ❌ NOT an investment research platform like Messari
- ❌ NOT a VC tool (they have connections)
- ❌ NOT targeting companies with $100k+ budgets

### **What We ARE:**
- ✅ **The Tinder for Web3 partnerships**
- ✅ **Auto-generated profiles from verified on-chain/online data**
- ✅ **Zero barrier to entry** (profiles exist whether you sign up or not)
- ✅ **Affordable** ($99-499/month, not $10k+)
- ✅ **Data-driven** (verified data only, no self-reporting)
- ✅ **Survival-focused** (extend runway, avoid shutdown)

---

## 🎯 Positioning

### **Tagline:**
> "Tinder for Web3 Partnerships. Swipe Right to Survive."

### **One-Liner:**

## 🎯 Key Messaging

### **Problem Statement:**
```
Why Web3 Startups Die:
❌ Running out of runway (6-12 months left)
❌ No distribution/users (can't compete with giants)
❌ No connections (big VCs have them, small startups don't)
❌ Can't afford help (consultants cost $10-50k/month)

Result: 90% shut down - even though partnerships could have saved them
```
