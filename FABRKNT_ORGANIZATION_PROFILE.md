## Mission

Our mission is to **democratize access to trustworthy Web3 company data** and enable better decisions across M&A, partnerships, and investments.

---

## Vision

FABRKNT is building the future of **Web3 verification and synergy**.

We believe that **Web3 deserves better signals**. Verification beats trust. Data beats narratives. Transparency compounds.

---

## Core Beliefs

**Web3 deserves better signals.**

-   Verification beats trust.
-   Data beats narratives.
-   Transparency compounds.

**FABRKNT is built in public — because credibility matters.**

> **Pitch decks lie. On-chain data doesn't.**

> FABRKNT does not rank narratives.
> We index reality.

## The Problem We Solve

Web3 has a trust problem:

-   User numbers are inflated
-   GitHub looks active — until you check
-   "Strategic partnerships" don't exist
-   M&A and investments start with slides, not reality

**Most Web3 decisions are still made on unverified claims.**

---

## Our Solution

FABRKNT fixes the first step.

**No forms.**
**No pitch decks.**
**No self-reported metrics.**

**Only signals that can be verified.**

### How It Works

1. **Verify**
   Automated analysis of on-chain data, GitHub activity, and social signals.

2. **Index**
   Companies ranked on real metrics, not marketing claims.

3. **Discover**
   AI-powered synergy matching based on verified compatibility.

## Products

### INDEX — Web3 Company Verification

An automated index that shows what Web3 companies actually do — not what they say.

**What we verify:**

-   **On-chain growth**
    Wallet activity, protocol usage, real traction

-   **Team & code health**
    GitHub commits, contributors, retention, code quality

-   **Signal integrity**
    Cross-verified via blockchain and public APIs

**If it can't be verified, it doesn't count.**

### SYNERGY — Discover Verified Connections

Find acquisition targets, integration partners, and strategic opportunities—quietly, using verified data.

**Built for:**

-   Corp Dev teams scouting quietly
-   Integration and acquisition opportunities
-   Early M&A conversations
-   Strategic partnerships

**AI-powered compatibility scoring based on verified data**, not pitch decks.

---

## Our Approach

-   **100% automated verification**
    No manual input, no manipulation—just trustworthy, objective index.

-   **No self-reported metrics**
    We only use data that can be independently verified.

-   **Built for Web3, by Web3**
    We understand the unique challenges of the Web3 ecosystem.

---

## Who We Serve

### Corp Dev & M&A Teams

Avoid bad first calls. Screen candidates before outreach.

### Web3 Investors & Funds

Run pre-DD before the pitch deck arrives.

### Web3 Founders

Get discovered for what you actually build — not how well you sell.

---

## Design Philosophy

FABRKNT uses a **Financial Terminal aesthetic** — dark, data-dense, and professional.

Think data infrastructure, not marketing. Built for serious business decisions.

**Color System:**
-   **Cyan terminal accents** — data, technology, verified signals
-   **Emerald green** — discovery, verified states, success
-   **Dark slate backgrounds** — professional, focused, authoritative

---

## Technology & Methodology

### Data Sources

-   **On-chain data:** Contracts, wallets, DAOs, transaction history
-   **GitHub activity:** Commits, contributors, retention, code quality
-   **Social signals:** Twitter, Discord, Telegram engagement

### Verification Process

All company metrics are automatically verified through:

-   On-chain data (contracts, wallets, DAOs)
-   Off-chain sources (GitHub, Discord, Twitter)

No manual data entry means trustworthy, objective index.
