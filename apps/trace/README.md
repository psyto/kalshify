# Product Requirements Document: TRACE

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** TRACE (Part of the Fabrknt Suite)

**Domain:** `trace.fabrknt.com`

**Concept:** A high-precision Web3 marketing attribution and "Ad-Audit" tool with comprehensive on-chain activity monitoring capabilities.

**Role in Suite:** **Growth Verification.** TRACE collects verified marketing ROI, user acquisition quality, and service activity metrics. This backing data powers ACQUIRE, enabling buyers to see authenticated growth signals when evaluating Web3 service listings. It proves to potential buyers on ACQUIRE that a project's user acquisition is real, efficient, and bot-free. Additionally, it demonstrates that the service is actively being used through comprehensive on-chain activity monitoring.

## 2. Branding & Aesthetic (The Fabrknt Suite Standard)

- **Visual Identity:** Consistent with `www.fabrknt.com`. Minimalist, monochromatic, and architectural.
- **UX Goal:** "Information Density with Clarity." Use a clean grid system to present complex data without clutter.
- **Typography:** Bold geometric headers with light-weight data values to emphasize the "Measured" precision.

---

## 3. Core Features (The Growth Audit Engine)

### 3.1. Web3 Attribution Engine

- **Click-to-Wallet Mapping:** A lightweight tracking script that associates off-chain marketing links (X, Discord, Telegram) with specific wallet addresses upon connection.
- **UTM for Web3:** Support for custom parameters to track specific influencers, campaigns, or community raids.

### 3.2. On-chain Conversion Tracking (The ROI Proof)

- **Event Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of specific smart contract interactions (e.g., `Mint`, `Swap`, `Stake`, `Vote`).
- **Conversion Attribution:** Directly link a $50,000 swap or a rare NFT mint back to the specific marketing dollar spent.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Initial focus on high-velocity chains like **Base**, **Solana**, and **Astar**.

### 3.3. Bot & Sybil Auditing

- **Wallet Hygiene Check:** Flagging "empty" or "just-created" wallets to identify bot-driven marketing inflation.
- **Retention Analysis:** Tracking if acquired wallets stay active or dump assets immediately (Loyalty Score).

### 3.4. General On-Chain Activity Monitoring

- **Protocol Activity Tracking:** Monitor all on-chain activity regardless of marketing attribution, providing comprehensive visibility into service usage and adoption.
- **Service Health Metrics:** Real-time tracking of key activity indicators:
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
  - Transaction volume and frequency
  - Unique wallet interactions
  - Smart contract interaction patterns
- **Activity Trends:** Historical analysis showing growth, decline, or stability trends over time.
- **Protocol Activity Score:** A composite metric (0-100) quantifying overall on-chain activity levels, proving that services are actively being used.
- **Multi-Contract Monitoring:** Track activity across multiple smart contracts within a single protocol or ecosystem.

### 3.5. ACQUIRE Integration (The "Export to Exit" Feature)

- **Backing Data for ACQUIRE:** TRACE provides verified growth and activity metrics that power ACQUIRE listings. Every Web3 service listing on ACQUIRE includes authenticated marketing ROI and service activity data from TRACE.
- **Verification API:** A dedicated endpoint that allows **acquire.fabrknt.com** to pull a "Growth Certificate" with verified metrics.
- **Trust Signal:** Listings on ACQUIRE will display a "TRACE-Verified ROI" badge, significantly increasing buyer confidence and valuation. Buyers can see verified growth signals, eliminating information asymmetry.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1. Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI.
- **Hosting:** AWS Amplify Hosting (consistent with main website)
- **Backend:** Amazon RDS PostgreSQL for attribution mapping; Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) for high-speed click tracking.
- **API:** AWS API Gateway + Lambda for serverless APIs
- **On-Chain Data:** \* **EVM:** Viem + Alchemy Custom Webhooks (processed via Lambda).
- **Solana:** Helius Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API & Webhooks (processed via Lambda).
- **Infrastructure:** AWS Lambda@Edge or CloudFront Functions for global low-latency link redirection.
- **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito with wallet-based authentication
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 for static assets and data exports
- **Monitoring:** Amazon CloudWatch for logs and metrics

### 4.2. Database Schema (High Level)

- `campaigns`: Owner, target contract, budget, goal.
- `clicks`: Click ID, metadata (IP, Ref, UA), timestamp.
- `conversions`: Wallet address, click ID, transaction hash, USD value at time of txn.
- `activity_metrics`: Protocol-level activity tracking (DAU, WAU, MAU, transaction volume, activity score).
- `contract_interactions`: All smart contract interactions regardless of marketing attribution.

## 5. Development Strategy (AI Prompts)

### Step 1: The Attribution Script

> "Create a lightweight JavaScript snippet that captures a URL parameter called 'fbk_id', stores it in local storage, and provides a function `getTraceId()` that can be called when a wallet is connected. The code must be under 2KB."

### Step 2: The On-chain Auditor

> "Develop a background worker in TypeScript using Viem. It should take a list of wallet addresses and a contract address, then scan the last 10,000 blocks for specific function calls made by those wallets. Return a summary of total volume and transaction count."

### Step 3: The Suite Dashboard

> "Design a dashboard for `trace.fabrknt.com` using the https://www.google.com/search?q=fabrknt.com aesthetic. It should feature a 'Verified ROI' summary card, a 'Protocol Activity Score' card showing overall service health, and a real-time table of on-chain conversions labeled 'Live Pulse of Growth'. Include activity trend charts showing DAU/WAU/MAU over time."

### Step 4: Activity Monitoring Worker

> "Develop a background worker that continuously monitors all on-chain activity for specified smart contracts. It should track transaction counts, unique wallets, volume, and calculate an Activity Score. Store metrics in time-series format for trend analysis. Support both campaign-attributed and general activity tracking."

## 6. Synergy Logic: The "Fabrknt Suite" Workflow

1. **Build:** You build a project.
2. **Operate (PULSE):** You track development activity to prove the team is "alive" and efficient.
3. **Grow (TRACE):** You run ads/marketing and prove that every $1 spent results in $X of on-chain volume. Additionally, you monitor all on-chain activity to demonstrate that your service is actively being used, regardless of marketing spend.
4. **Exit (ACQUIRE):** You list the project on ACQUIRE. The buyer sees verified **PULSE** data (Operational Health) and verified **TRACE** data (Growth Efficiency + Service Activity). The Activity Score proves the service has real usage, not just marketing-driven spikes. This backing data enables trusted transactions with complete transparency.
5. **Result:** The "Information Asymmetry" is eliminated, leading to a faster close and a higher sale price. Buyers can evaluate Web3 services with confidence, knowing they have access to authenticated team vitality and growth metrics.
