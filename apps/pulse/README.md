# Product Requirements Document: PULSE

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** PULSE (Part of the Fabrknt Suite)

**Domain:** `pulse.fabrknt.com`

**Concept:** A decentralized contribution scoring and "Proof of Contribution" (PoC) protocol for DAOs and Web3 teams.

**Role in Suite:** **Operational Verification.** PULSE collects verified team vitality and contribution quality data. This backing data powers ACQUIRE, enabling buyers to see authenticated team health metrics when evaluating Web3 service listings. It proves to potential buyers on ACQUIRE that the project has a healthy, productive, and high-quality human capital foundation.

## 2. Branding & Aesthetic (The Fabrknt Suite Standard)

- **Visual Identity:** "Human-centric but precise." While maintaining the monochromatic Fabrknt look, PULSE uses elegant data visualizations (e.g., contribution heatmaps, radar charts) to represent human effort.
- **Tone:** Appreciative, Transparent, and Meritocratic. It moves away from "surveillance" (Web2) toward "recognition" (Web3).
- **Typography:** Clean tabular data layouts that prioritize readability for reward distribution.

## 3. Core Functional Modules

### 3.1. Multi-Platform Connectivity (The Collectors)

- **Discord Integration:** Track not just message volume, but high-value engagement (reactions received, helpfulness in support channels, onboarding assistance).
- **GitHub Integration:** Monitor Pull Requests, code reviews, and documentation updates (beyond just commit counts).
- **Notion/Docs Integration:** Track organizational contributions, such as meeting minutes and wiki updates.

### 3.2. Qualitative Scoring Algorithm (The "Omotenashi" Logic)

- **Contribution Weighting:** A unique algorithm that rewards "Quality over Quantity."
- _Example:_ A detailed technical documentation update is weighted higher than 100 "GM" messages.

- **Peer Recognition:** Integration of slash commands (e.g., `/praise @user`) to allow community-driven qualitative boosts.

### 3.3. Proof of Contribution (PoC) Reports

- **Weekly Pulse:** Automated summary reports for DAO leads showing the "Health Score" of the organization.
- **Individual Builder Profiles:** A professional "on-chain resume" for every contributor showing their verified impact.

### 3.4. SBT (Soulbound Token) Issuance

- **Automated Badging:** Upon reaching specific scoring milestones, PULSE automatically triggers the minting of non-transferable Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to the contributor's wallet.
- **Metadata:** The SBT contains the metadata of the specific contribution period, serving as a permanent record of merit.

### 3.5. ACQUIRE Integration (The "Team Vitality" Signal)

- **Backing Data for ACQUIRE:** PULSE provides verified team vitality data that powers ACQUIRE listings. Every Web3 service listing on ACQUIRE includes authenticated team health metrics from PULSE.
- **Vitality Badge:** Listings on **acquire.fabrknt.com** pull data from PULSE to show the "Team Retention" and "Developer Activity" scores.
- **Buyer Value:** Buyers can see that they are not just buying code, but an active, healthy ecosystem of contributors. This verified backing data eliminates information asymmetry and enables trusted transactions.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS.
- **Hosting:** AWS Amplify Hosting (consistent with main website)
- **Charts:** Recharts or Nivo (Customized for monochromatic/minimalist style).
- **Backend:** Amazon RDS PostgreSQL for indexing off-chain activity (Discord/GitHub metadata).
- **API:** AWS API Gateway + Lambda for serverless APIs
- **Background Workers:** AWS Lambda triggered by EventBridge for scheduled tasks and webhooks
- **Web3/SBT:** Cross-chain SBT minting engine (Base, Solana, or Polygon) using **Hardhat** or **Foundry** (deployed via Lambda).
- **Oracles:** Integration with **Chainlink Functions** to bring off-chain contribution scores on-chain for minting.
- **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito with wallet-based authentication
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 for user uploads and reports
- **Monitoring:** Amazon CloudWatch for logs and metrics

### 4.2. API & Webhooks

- `GET /api/v1/score/{wallet}`: Returns the current contribution score.
- `POST /api/v1/discord/webhook`: Ingests Discord activity logs.
- `POST /api/v1/mint-sbt`: Triggers the on-chain badge issuance.

## 5. Development Strategy (AI Prompts)

### Step 1: The Activity Aggregator

> "Build a Node.js service that connects to the GitHub API. It should fetch the number of Pull Requests and Code Reviews for a specific repository over the last 30 days and return a JSON object that weights Reviews as 1.5x more valuable than commits."

### Step 2: The "Omotenashi" UI

> "Create a minimalist React component for a 'Contribution Heatmap'. Unlike GitHub's green squares, use a grayscale map consistent with the https://www.google.com/search?q=fabrknt.com design. It should show 'Active Days' and 'High Impact Actions' separately."

### Step 3: SBT Minting Logic

> "Draft a Solidity contract for a non-transferable Soulbound Token (SBT). It should have a function `issueBadge(address contributor, string memory metadataURI)` that can only be called by the PULSE platform owner."

## 6. The Fabrknt Suite: Unified Ecosystem

By completing **PULSE**, your suite now covers the entire Web3 project lifecycle:

- **PULSE:** Collects verified team vitality data. Proves the **Humans** are working (Vitality).
- **TRACE:** Collects verified growth and activity metrics. Proves the **Marketing** is working (Growth).
- **ACQUIRE:** Leverages backing data from PULSE and TRACE to enable trusted Web3 service transactions. Proves the **Value** is transferable (Exit).

The verified data from PULSE and TRACE powers ACQUIRE, enabling buyers and sellers to transact with complete transparency and data-backed valuations.
