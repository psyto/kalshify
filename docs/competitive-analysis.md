# FABRKNT Competitive Analysis

*Last updated: January 2025*

## Market Landscape

The DeFi yield space has several categories of players:

| Category | Examples | What They Do |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Data Platforms** | DefiLlama, De.Fi, Nansen | Show metrics, TVL, APY data |
| **Yield Aggregators** | Kamino, Voltr, Meteora, Tulip | Auto-compound, manage liquidity |
| **Risk Curators** | Gauntlet, Steakhouse, RE7 | Manage vaults with specific risk mandates |
| **Portfolio Trackers** | Jupiter Portfolio, Zapper, DeBank | Track existing positions |

## Detailed Comparison

### vs. Data Platforms (DefiLlama, De.Fi, Exponential)

| Aspect | DefiLlama / De.Fi | FABRKNT |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Approach** | "Here's all the data" | "Here's what to do" |
| **Output** | Tables, filters, charts | Personalized allocation + execution steps |
| **User effort** | High (analyze yourself) | Low (30 seconds) |
| **Target user** | Researchers, analysts | Anyone with capital to deploy |
| **Custody** | N/A (data only) | Non-custodial (recommendations only) |

**FABRKNT advantage:** Bridges the gap between data and action. DefiLlama shows 500+ pools; FABRKNT tells you which 3-5 to use.

**FABRKNT gap:** Less comprehensive data coverage. DefiLlama tracks all chains; FABRKNT is Solana-only.

### vs. Yield Aggregators (Kamino, Voltr, Meteora)

| Aspect | Kamino / Voltr | FABRKNT |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Model** | Custodial vaults | Non-custodial recommendations |
| **Execution** | Automatic (deposit & forget) | Manual (user executes) |
| **Risk** | Smart contract risk | No contract risk |
| **Fees** | Performance/management fees | Free |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to vault strategies | Any pool combination |

**FABRKNT advantage:** No custody risk, no fees, full control. Users learn while deploying.

**FABRKNT gap:** More friction—user must execute each step manually. No auto-compounding.

---

### vs. Risk Curators (Gauntlet, Steakhouse, RE7)

| Aspect | Gauntlet / Steakhouse | FABRKNT |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| **Service** | Managed vaults (deposit funds) | Recommendations (you execute) |
| **Minimum** | Often $10K+ or institutional | $100 |
| **Transparency** | Methodology published, but opaque execution | Full visibility into reasoning |
| **Learning** | None (trust the curator) | Built-in education |
| **Customization** | Choose vault tier (Prime/Core/Frontier) | Customize individual pools |

**FABRKNT advantage:** Democratizes curator-level thinking. Shows *why* curators allocate the way they do, not just *what* they hold.

**FABRKNT gap:** No track record. Curators like Gauntlet have years of audited performance.

---

### vs. Portfolio Trackers (Jupiter Portfolio, Zapper)

| Aspect | Jupiter / Zapper | FABRKNT |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Function** | Track existing positions | Recommend new positions |
| **When to use** | After deploying | Before deploying |
| **Wallet connection** | Required | Not required |
| **Actionability** | Low (shows what you have) | High (tells you what to do) |

**FABRKNT advantage:** Complements trackers. Jupiter shows your current state; FABRKNT tells you how to improve it.

**FABRKNT gap:** No position tracking after deployment. Users need separate tool to monitor.

## FABRKNT's Unique Position

**The Try → Track → Trust → Trade Journey**

Unlike competitors who ask users to either trust blindly (vaults) or figure it out themselves (data platforms), FABRKNT offers a trust-building journey:

| Step | What Happens | Competitive Advantage |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Try** | Get personalized allocation in 30 seconds | Faster than any competitor |
| **Track** | Paper Portfolio Dashboard tracks performance | No vault required, no risk |
| **Trust** | 14+ days of real performance data | Builds confidence before investing |
| **Trade** | Step-by-step execution instructions | More control than vaults |

**What FABRKNT does that no one else does:**

1. **Risk-free testing** — Paper trade before committing real capital. No other platform offers this.

2. **Trust through transparency** — Watch performance over time instead of trusting marketing claims.

3. **Non-custodial recommendations** — Unlike aggregators, we never touch funds. Unlike data platforms, we give specific advice.

4. **Education built-in** — Compare your allocation to curators. Understand *why*, not just *what*.

5. **Connected experience** — Allocation persists across tabs. Customize in Explore, compare vs curators in Compare, refine in Practice.

## Competitive Gaps to Address

| Gap | Impact | Potential Solution |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| **No track record** | Hard to trust new platform | Backtest allocations, show historical performance |
| **Manual execution** | Friction vs. vaults | Partner with protocols for one-click execution |
| **Solana only** | Limited market | Expand to EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum) |
| **Paper trading only** | Users want real position tracking | Add real portfolio monitoring after deployment |
| **Free tier sustainability** | No revenue | Premium features (alerts, advanced AI, API access) |

---

## Summary

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| **Try → Track → Trust → Trade** journey | No track record yet |
| Risk-free paper trading | Manual execution friction |
| Non-custodial | Solana only |
| Educational | New entrant, low awareness |
| Fast (30 seconds) | Paper trading only (no real portfolio tracking) |
| Paper Portfolio Dashboard | |

**Bottom line:** FABRKNT's **Try → Track → Trust → Trade** journey is our key differentiator. We're more actionable than data platforms, more transparent than vaults, and more accessible than institutional curators. Users can verify our recommendations work before risking real money—something no competitor offers.
