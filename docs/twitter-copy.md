### Origin Story Tweet

```
Why I'm building Kalshify:

Prediction markets are powerful.
But Kalshi is US-only.

95% of the world is locked out.

So I built a paper trading platform.
Same markets. Same data. Global access.

Experience Kalshi from anywhere.
```

### Building in Public Tweet

```
Building Kalshify for the Kalshi Hackathon.

### Philosophy Tweet

```
Prediction markets should be global.

Not everyone can risk real money.
Not everyone lives in the US.

Kalshify: Practice prediction markets risk-free.

When you're ready for real trading, Kalshi will be waiting.
```

## Thread: The Kalshify Story

**Tweet 1/4:**
```
I wanted to trade on Kalshi.

Problem: I'm in Tokyo.

Kalshi requires US residency.

So I built Kalshify. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/4:**
```
Kalshify gives you:

- Real Kalshi market data
- Paper trading (no real money)
- AI-powered recommendations
- P&L tracking
- Global leaderboard

Everything except the real money part.
```

**Tweet 3/4:**
```
Why this matters:

Prediction markets are powerful.
They aggregate information efficiently.
They deserve global adoption.

But you can't adopt what you can't access.

Kalshify is the on-ramp.
```

**Tweet 4/4:**
