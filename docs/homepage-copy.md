## POSITIONING

**Tagline:**
Get personalized DeFi allocations in 30 seconds.

**One-liner:**
Actionable recommendations, not data dumps.

**Problem we solve:**
Most DeFi tools show you data and expect you to figure it out. FABRKNT tells you exactly where to put your money.

**How we're different:**

| Data Platforms | FABRKNT |
|----------------|---------|
| Show APY numbers | Tell you which ones to use |
| Display risk scores | Explain why risks matter |
| List protocols | Give you actionable steps |
| Raw data dumps | Personalized recommendations |
| Dashboards to browse | Allocations to execute |

---

## TRUST & SECURITY

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Read-Only** | We never request wallet permissions |
| **Non-Custodial** | Your keys, your funds. We never touch assets |
| **Transparent** | Our methodology is open |
