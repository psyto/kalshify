## PROBLEM SECTION

**Section label:** (small, above heading)
The problem

**Heading:**
Dashboards show you data. They don't teach you how to think.

**Body:**
You can find APYs anywhere. But knowing that a pool offers 12% doesn't tell you:

- Is that yield sustainable or just token emissions?
- How much should you allocate to it?
- What happens if the market crashes?

Most DeFi users copy strategies they don't understand. When conditions change, they don't know how to adapt.
