*Target length: 3 minutes*
*Format: Screen recording with voiceover (or founder on camera + screen demos)*

---

## Pre-Production Notes

**Video Style Options:**
- **Option A**: Founder on camera (builds trust) + screen demos
- **Option B**: Screen recording only with voiceover (simpler production)
- **Option C**: Hybrid - founder intro/outro, screen demos in middle

**Recommended**: Option A or C - showing your face builds credibility with judges

**Recording Tips:**
- Good lighting, clean background
- Clear audio (use external mic if possible)
- 1080p minimum resolution
- Practice 2-3 times before final recording

## Script

### HOOK (0:00 - 0:20)

**[ON CAMERA or VOICEOVER with problem visuals]**

> "Imagine you find a DeFi pool offering 25% APY.
>
> Looks great. But how do you know it's real?
>
> You don't. Not until you've risked real money.
>
> Most DeFi tools ask for blind trust.
>
> FABRKNT asks: why should you have to trust at all?"

**[VISUAL]**: Quick montage - high APY screenshots, "trust me bro" memes, headlines about DeFi losses

---

### PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:45)

**[ON CAMERA or VOICEOVER]**

> "Here's the problem with DeFi today.
>
> Vaults say: 'Deposit your funds and trust us.'
>
> Data platforms say: 'Here's 500 pools. Figure it out yourself.'
>
> And influencers? 'This APY is amazing.' No proof. Just vibes.
>
> Meanwhile, institutional investors? They never invest without backtesting first.
>
> Why should retail be any different?"

**[VISUAL]**: Split screen comparison
- Left: Institutional due diligence process
- Right: Retail "ape in" culture

---

### SOLUTION INTRO (0:45 - 1:00)

**[ON CAMERA]**

> "That's why I built FABRKNT.
>
> A simple idea: what if you could test DeFi strategies before risking real money?
>
> We call it: Try, Track, Trust, Trade."

**[VISUAL]**: Show the 4-step journey graphic with icons

---

### DEMO - TRY (1:00 - 1:25)

**[SCREEN RECORDING - fabrknt.com]**

> "Let me show you how it works.
>
> Step one: Try.
>
> You come to FABRKNT. Enter your investment amount. Pick your risk tolerance.
>
> In 30 seconds, you get a personalized allocation.
>
> No wallet connection. No sign-up. Just answers."

### DEMO - TRACK (1:25 - 1:50)

**[SCREEN RECORDING - Paper Portfolio Dashboard]**

> "Step two: Track.
>
> Your allocation automatically saves to the Paper Portfolio Dashboard.
>
> Here you can see your paper value, estimated yield, and average APY.
>
> This sparkline shows if your APY is rising, falling, or stable.
>
> And this ring? That's your trust progress. We recommend tracking for 14 days minimum."

**[VISUAL]**: Highlight each element as you mention it
1. Paper Value
2. Estimated Yield
3. APY with sparkline
4. Trust Progress Ring

---

### DEMO - TRUST (1:50 - 2:05)

**[SCREEN RECORDING or ON CAMERA]**

> "Step three: Trust.
>
> After 14 days, you have real data. Not marketing claims. Actual performance.
>
> You can see: did this strategy work? How did APY trend over time?
>
> Now you have proof. Trust is earned, not assumed."

**[VISUAL]**: Show performance data, APY history, trust badge earned

### DEMO - TRADE (2:05 - 2:15)

**[SCREEN RECORDING]**

> "Step four: Trade.
>
> When you're confident, execute with step-by-step instructions.

>
> You're in control. Invest when YOU'RE ready."

> We're non-custodial. We never touch your funds.
>
> We're free. No hidden fees.
>
> And we're transparent. You can compare your allocation against professional curators like Gauntlet and Steakhouse. See how they allocate—and why.
>
> We're not just giving you data. We're giving you answers you can verify."
