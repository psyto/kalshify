## Core Features

### Get Started Tab (Primary Flow)

The fastest way to get a DeFi allocation:

#### Step 1: Your Preferences
- Enter investment amount ($100 to any amount)
- Select risk tolerance:
  - **Safe** (4-7% APY) — Stablecoin-heavy, minimal risk
  - **Balanced** (7-12% APY) — Mix of stable and growth
  - **Growth** (12-25%+ APY) — Higher risk, higher potential

#### Step 2: Your Allocation
- Personalized pool recommendations
- Expected APY and annual yield
- Risk breakdown and warnings
- "Why this allocation" insights

#### Step 3: Execute
- Step-by-step instructions for each position
- Direct links to protocols (Kamino, Marginfi, Meteora, etc.)
- Copy-paste amounts
- Progress tracking (mark steps completed)

### Connected Tabs Experience

Once you have an allocation, all tabs work together:

| Feature | Where | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Allocation Banner** | Insights, Explore, Learn | Summary bar showing your allocation with "View allocation" link |
| **Your Allocation vs Curator** | Insights | Side-by-side comparison with matching curator (by risk profile) |

#### Your Allocation vs Curator
If you have an allocation from Get Started:
- Side-by-side comparison with a curator matching your risk profile
- See expected APY and risk level differences
- Understand how your choices compare to professionals

#### Curation Principles
Six mental models that guide professional curators:
- **Risk/Reward Balance** — Higher yield = higher risk, always
- **Diversification** — Spread risk across protocols and assets
- **Yield Sustainability** — Base APY vs temporary emissions
- **Protocol Trust** — TVL, audits, track record
- **Liquidity Depth** — Can you exit without slippage?
- **Correlation** — Understand how positions move together

Click any principle to see a detailed explanation with examples.

#### Curator Strategies
