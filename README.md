# Fabrknt Suite: Web3 Intelligence & Matching Platform

**Intelligence → Match: AI-Powered Company Intelligence & Matching Platform for Web3 SMEs**

**Domain:** `www.fabrknt.com`

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Fabrknt Suite (Powered by Fabrknt)

**Concept:** A next-generation Web3 corporate analysis and matching platform consisting of two integrated products: **Intelligence** (automated company intelligence) and **Match** (M&A & partnership matching). Intelligence provides verified company intelligence combining growth metrics and team health data. Match leverages Intelligence data to power M&A and partnership matching, enabling high-trust business transactions with complete transparency.

**Architecture:** **Intelligence → Match** - Intelligence serves as the data foundation that powers Match's matching and decision-making capabilities. Every Match listing is backed by verified Intelligence data, ensuring transparency and trust.

**Positioning:** **AI × SME Specialization × Integrated Advisory** - Maximizing automation through AI to drastically improve the cost and time efficiency of M&A and partnership processes in the Web3 market, where information asymmetry is high.

## 2. Market Opportunity

### Web3 Market Growth

The Web3 market is estimated to be between **$3.47 billion and $7.23 billion** as of 2025, with projections to expand to **$41.4 billion – $42.3 billion by 2030** (CAGR of approximately 42%–45%).

### SME Segment Opportunity

The growth rate of SMEs within the Web3 market is particularly noteworthy. While large enterprises currently lead with a 60.9% market share, the **SME segment is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 54.6% through 2030**, outstripping the pace of large corporations.

-   **Active Seed and Small-Scale Deals:** Approximately 36.4% of funding rounds are concentrated in the $1M to $5M range, making the seed round the most active phase.
-   **The Necessity of Consolidation:** Many small projects face resource shortages and intensifying competition. We have entered a "Consolidation Phase" where SMEs with high technical capabilities are being absorbed into larger ecosystems.

### Global Market Positioning

The platform serves the global Web3 ecosystem, focusing on SMEs that require efficient, data-driven M&A and partnership processes. As the market moves from "speculation to utility" and "isolation to integration," an infrastructure where AI bridges the gap between technology and business based on data is indispensable for the development of the global Web3 ecosystem.

## 3. AI Automation & Efficiency

The vision of "maximizing automation through AI" drastically improves the cost and time efficiency of traditional M&A processes in the Web3 market.

### Quantitative Evaluation of AI-Driven Efficiency

-   **Accelerated Sourcing and Evaluation:** By using AI algorithms to identify targets, the time required to locate and evaluate companies can be reduced by **over 50%**.
-   **High-Speed Document Processing:** AI agents utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) can process thousands of financial and legal documents in minutes to extract inconsistencies or legal risks. This shortens the review period for mid-market deals from weeks to days.
-   **Democratization of Technical Evaluation:** AI auditing tools detect smart contract vulnerabilities and assign security scores (0–100%). Furthermore, they translate complex code into language understandable by non-technical investors and executives.

### Three-Tier Data Integration

AI seamlessly combines three layers of data to provide a holistic view:

1. **On-chain:** Real-time monitoring of "Smart Money" movements and TVL trends via APIs (e.g., Nansen, Dune). Verified on-chain protocol fees, transaction volumes, and wallet quality metrics.
2. **Off-chain:** Traditional financial and legal information, GitHub activity, team contribution data, and service activity metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU).
3. **Online:** Sentiment analysis to distinguish between bot activity (airdrop farming) and genuine community growth. Social media metrics and community engagement data.

## 4. Platform Architecture: Intelligence → Match

The platform operates on a two-tier architecture where **Intelligence** serves as the data foundation that powers **Match**.

### 4.1. Intelligence: The Data Foundation

**Intelligence** provides automated, verified intelligence for Web3 companies by combining:

-   **Growth Metrics:** On-chain activity, wallet growth, user growth rates, TVL trends, and transaction volumes
-   **Team Health:** GitHub commits, active contributors, contributor retention, code quality, and team consistency
-   **Verified Intelligence:** Automated verification via blockchain and GitHub APIs—no manual input, just trustworthy metrics

**The "Fabrknt Score":** An aggregate intelligence score (0-100) calculated from:

-   **Growth Score:** On-chain conversion efficiency, wallet quality, and service activity metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU)
-   **Team Health Score:** Team contribution consistency and developer activity
-   **Revenue Verification:** Verified on-chain protocol fees or Stripe data

**Key Features:**

-   Automated analysis of on-chain data, GitHub activity, and social metrics
-   Real-time monitoring and updates
-   Comprehensive company directory with verified intelligence scores
-   Transparent, auditable data sources

### 4.2. Match: Powered by Intelligence Data

**Match** leverages Intelligence data to enable M&A and partnership matching:

-   **Automated Data Import:** Listings automatically pull verified intelligence data from Intelligence—no manual entry required
-   **The "Audit View":** Buyers can deep-dive into the raw intelligence data without leaving the Match interface
-   **AI-Powered Matching:** Automated compatibility analysis based on verified intelligence scores
-   **One-Click NDA:** Buyers sign an on-chain message to unlock "Privileged Data" (GitHub private repos, specific smart contract addresses)
-   **Proof of Funds (PoF):** Access to high-value listings is gated by a wallet-balance check to ensure only serious buyers engage

### 4.3. Partnership & Collaboration Matching

Beyond M&A transactions, **Match** serves as a comprehensive "matchmaking platform" for the Web3 ecosystem:

-   **Business Matchmaking:** Connect companies seeking infrastructure with SMEs possessing specific tech stacks (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs, DePIN)
-   **Technology-Complementary Alliances:** Match companies based on complementary capabilities and technical requirements, using Intelligence data to assess compatibility
-   **Partnership Types:** Support for technical, strategic, marketing, and ecosystem partnerships
-   **Post-Alliance Monitoring:** AI continuously analyzes on-chain activity post-partnership using Intelligence data to visualize and evaluate synergies, such as increases in user count or transaction volume

### 4.4. Transaction Protocol (The Deal Protocol)

-   **Atomic Escrow:** A smart contract-based swap where the purchase price (Stablecoins) is exchanged for project assets.
-   **Asset Packaging:**
    -   **Smart Contract Ownership:** Transfer of `Admin/Owner` roles.
    -   **Digital Assets:** ENS domains, GitHub organization access, and Social accounts.

---

## 5. Design System & Aesthetics

-   **Visual Identity:** Full consistency with `www.fabrknt.com`.
-   **The "Suite Ribbon":** Every Match listing features a dedicated data ribbon displaying real-time intelligence signals from Intelligence (growth metrics and team health).
-   **Minimalist Architecture:** The UI feels like a "Financial Terminal"—functional, fast, and devoid of "Crypto-hype" visuals.

## 6. Intelligence → Match Data Flow

**Intelligence** collects and verifies data, which **Match** uses for matching and decision-making:

| Intelligence Data  | Used by Match For                                                                     | Impact on Matching & Valuation                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Growth Metrics** | Verified On-chain ROI / Marketing efficiency + Service activity metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU) | Proves the product is "market-fit", scalable, and actively being used by real users |
| **Team Health**    | Team contribution score / Developer activity / Code quality                           | Reduces "Key Person Risk" by proving a healthy team and sustainable development     |
| **Overall Score**  | Automated compatibility analysis and ranking                                          | Enables AI-powered matching based on verified intelligence scores                   |
