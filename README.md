## Core Features

### Get Started Tab (Primary Flow)

The fastest way to get a DeFi allocation:

#### Step 1: Your Preferences
- Enter investment amount ($100 to any amount)
- Select risk tolerance:
  - **Safe** (4-7% APY) — Stablecoin-heavy, minimal risk
  - **Balanced** (7-12% APY) — Mix of stable and growth
  - **Growth** (12-25%+ APY) — Higher risk, higher potential

#### Step 2: Your Allocation
- Personalized pool recommendations
- Expected APY and annual yield
- Risk breakdown and warnings
- "Why this allocation" insights

#### Step 3: Execute
- Step-by-step instructions for each position
- Direct links to protocols (Kamino, Marginfi, Meteora, etc.)
- Copy-paste amounts
- Progress tracking (mark steps completed)

#### Paper Portfolio Dashboard
After getting your allocation, you'll see the Paper Portfolio Dashboard:
- **Paper Value** — Total amount being tracked
- **Estimated Yield** — Expected earnings to date
- **Average APY** — Weighted APY across all positions
- **Trust Progress** — 14-day ring showing progress toward building trust
- **APY Sparklines** — Visual trend indicators (rising, falling, stable)

Your allocation auto-saves to Paper Portfolio. Track for 14+ days to build trust, then execute when confident.

### Connected Tabs Experience

Once you have an allocation, all tabs work together:

| Feature | Where | Description |

| **Load My Allocation** | Practice | One-click import into Strategy Builder for customization |

If you have an allocation from Get Started:

#### Curation Principles
Six mental models that guide professional curators:
- **Risk/Reward Balance** — Higher yield = higher risk, always

- **Protocol Trust** — TVL, audits, track record
- **Liquidity Depth** — Can you exit without slippage?
- **Correlation** — Understand how positions move together
