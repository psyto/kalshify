  - **Synergy** - Discover and connect with verified companies
- **Terminology**:
  - Use "synergy" or "connections" instead of "partnerships"
  - "Express interest" instead of "swipe right"

## Page-by-Page Updates

### 1. Landing Page (src/app/page.tsx)

#### Hero Section
**CURRENT:**
```
Verify Web3. Before You Trust It.
Pitch decks lie. On-chain data doesn't.

FABRKNT helps Web3 Corp Dev teams, investors, and founders verify
companies using real on-chain activity, GitHub signals, and social
data — fully automated, no self-reporting.
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
Verify Web3. Discover Synergy.

Pitch decks lie. On-chain data doesn't.

FABRKNT helps Web3 teams make confident decisions with verified
company data and AI-powered synergy discovery — no self-reporting,
just real signals.
```

**REASONING:**
- Adds "Discover Synergy" to include both products
- "Web3 teams" is cleaner than listing all roles
- "Confident decisions" emphasizes outcome
- "AI-powered synergy discovery" positions Synergy as smart, not random

---

#### Stats Section
**CURRENT:**
```
Built for people who make irreversible decisions
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
Built for teams making million-dollar decisions
```

**REASONING:** More specific, emphasizes stakes

---

#### Index Section
**CURRENT:**
```
Verify Before You Trust

The Web3 Index ranks companies by what matters: on-chain TVL,
GitHub commits, wallet quality, social reach—not promises.
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
Index: Verify Before You Trust

Rank companies by what matters: on-chain TVL, GitHub commits,
wallet quality, and social signals—not promises.
```

**REASONING:**
- Add "Index:" label for clarity
- "Social signals" instead of "social reach" (more professional)

---

#### Synergy Section
**CURRENT:**
```
Quiet M&A & Partnerships

Discover acquisition targets and partnership opportunities —
without broadcasting intent.
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
Synergy: Discover Verified Connections

Find acquisition targets, integration partners, and strategic
opportunities—quietly, using verified data.
```

**REASONING:**
- "Synergy:" label for consistency
- "Verified Connections" emphasizes data-driven approach
- Removed "partnership" terminology (use synergy/connections)
- "Quietly, using verified data" - cleaner, emphasizes both privacy and data quality

---

#### Synergy Features
**CURRENT:**
```
- AI-powered compatibility analysis based on verified index scores, not narratives.
- Strategic partnerships and integrations
- Cross-protocol opportunities
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
- AI-powered compatibility scoring based on verified data, not pitch decks
- Integration and acquisition opportunities
- Cross-ecosystem synergies
```

**REASONING:**
- "Compatibility scoring" sounds more professional than "analysis"
- Remove "partnerships" term
- "Cross-ecosystem" is more Web3-native than "cross-protocol"

---

#### How It Works Section
**CURRENT:**
```
1. Verify - We automatically analyze on-chain data, GitHub activity, and social signals.
2. Index - Companies are ranked on real performance, not marketing.
3. Discover - Find M&A targets or integration partners that match your criteria.
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
1. Verify - Automated analysis of on-chain data, GitHub activity, and social signals
2. Index - Companies ranked on real metrics, not marketing claims
3. Discover - AI-powered synergy matching based on verified compatibility
```

**REASONING:**
- More concise
- "AI-powered synergy matching" highlights the intelligent matching
- "Verified compatibility" ties back to core value prop

---

#### CTA Section
**CURRENT:**
```
Stop trusting promises.
Start verifying.
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
Stop guessing.
Start verifying.
```

**REASONING:**
- "Guessing" is more relatable than "trusting promises"
- Emphasizes the uncertainty teams face

---

### 2. Sidebar (src/components/dashboard/dashboard-sidebar.tsx)

**CURRENT:**
```
Fabrknt Suite
Index + Synergy
Preview
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
FABRKNT
Index + Synergy
Beta
```

**REASONING:**
- Consistent capitalization (FABRKNT)
- "Beta" sounds more professional than "Preview"

---

### 3. Footer

**CURRENT:**
```
Fabrknt Suite
Index + Synergy
Preview
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
FABRKNT
Verify. Discover. Connect.
Beta
```

**REASONING:**
- Three-word tagline summarizes the flow

---

```

```
"Potential synergy between [category] companies"
```

---

### 5. Connections/Matches Page

**CURRENT:**
```
"Synergy Connections"
"New Connections"
"Start swiping to discover partnership opportunities!"
```

**PROPOSED:**
```
"Synergy Connections" ✅ (keep)
"New Connections" ✅ (keep)
"Discover companies with verified compatibility scores and start connecting!"
```

**REASONING:**
- Remove "swiping" language
- Emphasize "verified compatibility scores"

---
