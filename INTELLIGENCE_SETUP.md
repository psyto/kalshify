# Intelligence Company Data - Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide covers setting up the Company table in Supabase to store Intelligence data from the existing JSON files.

## What's Been Created

### ✅ Database Schema
- **Company model** added to `/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Stores company metadata, scores, and full Intelligence data as JSON
- Indexed for fast searching by slug, category, and overallScore

### ✅ API Routes
- **GET /api/intelligence/search** - Search companies by name/slug/description
  - Query params: `q` (search text), `category`, `limit`
  - Returns companies sorted by overallScore

- **GET /api/intelligence/[companyId]** - Get full company data with PULSE + TRACE
  - Returns formatted data matching create listing form expectations
  - Maps `intelligenceData` JSON to PULSE/TRACE structure

### ✅ Seed Script
- **`scripts/seed-companies.ts`** - Imports all companies from `/data/companies/*.json`
  - Reads 24 company JSON files
  - Upserts into Company table (updates if exists, creates if not)
  - Stores full `rawData` in `intelligenceData` JSON field

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Company Table in Supabase

Run the SQL migration in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lswqmdmzzmjpjsbmgpxq
2. Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
3. Create new query
4. Copy contents of `/supabase-add-company-table.sql`
5. Click "Run"

Expected output:
```
NOTICE: Company table created successfully!
```

### Step 2: Run Seed Script

After the table is created, populate it with company data:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-companies.ts
```

Expected output:
```
🌱 Seeding Company table from JSON files...

📁 Found 24 company files

✅ Jupiter (jupiter) - Score: 39
✅ Blur (blur) - Score: 85
✅ Drift (drift) - Score: 72
...

📊 Seeding complete!
   ✅ Success: 24
   ❌ Errors: 0

📈 Top 5 companies by score:
   1. Blur (nft): 85
   2. Drift (defi): 72
   ...

✨ Total companies in database: 24
```

### Step 3: Verify in Prisma Studio

```bash
pnpm prisma studio
```

Navigate to Company table and verify:
- 24 companies imported
- Scores populated (overallScore, teamHealthScore, etc.)
- intelligenceData JSON field has full data

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints

Start dev server (if not running):
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Test search:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/intelligence/search?q=jupiter
```

Test company detail:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/intelligence/[companyId]
```

Replace `[companyId]` with actual ID from search results.

## Company Data Structure

### Companies Available (24 total)

| Name | Category | Score | Trend |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Jupiter | defi | 39 | down |
| Blur | nft | 85 | up |
| Drift | defi | 72 | stable |
| Euler | defi | 68 | stable |
| Jito | infrastructure | 45 | stable |
| Kamino | defi | 54 | stable |
| Lido | defi | 62 | up |
| Mango Markets | defi | 51 | down |
| Marginfi | defi | 48 | stable |
| Metaplex | nft | 71 | up |
| Morpho | defi | 79 | up |
| Orca | defi | 67 | stable |
| ... (12 more) |

### Database Fields

**Company Table:**
- `id` - Auto-generated CUID
- `slug` - Unique identifier (e.g., "jupiter")
- `name` - Display name (e.g., "Jupiter")
- `category` - defi | nft | gaming | infrastructure | dao
- `description` - Short description
- `logo` - Emoji or URL
- `website` - Company website

**Cached Scores:**
- `overallScore` - 0-100 composite score
- `teamHealthScore` - PULSE vitality score (0-100)
- `growthScore` - TRACE growth score (0-100)
- `socialScore` - Social media score (0-100)
- `walletQualityScore` - Wallet distribution score (0-100)

**Metadata:**
- `trend` - up | down | stable (30-day trend)
- `isListed` - Whether company has a Match listing
- `isActive` - Soft delete flag
- `intelligenceData` - Full JSON (GitHub, Twitter, onchain data)
- `lastFetchedAt` - When data was last updated

## Integration with Create Listing Form

The Intelligence search API is used in **Step 5** of the create listing form:

1. User searches for company: `GET /api/intelligence/search?q=uniswap`
2. User selects company from results
3. Form fetches full data: `GET /api/intelligence/[companyId]`
4. Data is mapped to `suiteDataSnapshot` format:
   ```json
   {
     "pulse": {
       "vitality_score": 85,
       "developer_activity_score": 144,
       "team_retention_score": 42,
       "active_contributors": 42
     },
     "trace": {
       "growth_score": 16,
       "verified_roi": 1993,
       "roi_multiplier": 0,
       "quality_score": 39
     },
     "revenue_verified": 0,
     "fabrknt_score": 39
   }
   ```
5. Listing is saved with cached Intelligence snapshot

## Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. ✅ Test search in create listing form UI
2. ✅ Verify PULSE + TRACE data displays correctly
3. ⏳ Set up automatic data refresh (fetch new Intelligence data daily)
4. ⏳ Add webhook to update Company table when new data arrives

## Troubleshooting

### "Table 'Company' does not exist"
- Run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor first
- Run `pnpm prisma generate` after creating table

### Seed script fails
- Ensure `data/companies/` directory exists with JSON files
- Check Supabase connection in `.env.local`
- Verify table was created successfully

### API returns empty results
- Check that seed script ran successfully
- Verify companies in Prisma Studio
- Check `isActive = true` in database
